# Overview
A module for FoundryVTT that acts as a set of customisation options for the 'Game Paused' icon. This module is based on the [original module](https://gitlab.com/Freeze020/pause-icon/) created by Freeze.

## Original Features:
- Select custom images and customise their size.
- Reorient the pause bar with an offset.
- Disable the default background gradient and pulsing animation.
- Set rotation speed, with the option to disable it.

## New Feature:
- Overlay a second image, with one rotating. Have a clock face with spinning hands, or an icon with rotating text.

## Special Thanks
Thank you again to Freeze for creating the original.
